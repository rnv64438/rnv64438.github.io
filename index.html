  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>I love animals</em></p>
  <p>As is common among college students, I have had a hard time finding out who I am during these last four years. I have gone through many mental and societal challenges with depression, anxiety, finding and keeping friends, relationships, familial relationships, you name it. Through this, I have found my love for animals. They don't judge you, they don't have any ulterior motives, all they know is what they are shown by their experiences. If you show them love and kindness, they will give it right back. I know this personally by owning my two cats, Cleo and Winnie. 
  Cleo was adopted more recently and she is still a kitten, so she just shows love to anyone. However, with Winnie, I have had her since she was two months old. She is now two years old. We have a beautiful bond. She has been there for me through a majority of college so far, and she has shown nothing but affection for me (most of the time). She has taught me what no one else has ever given me in my life: unconditional love, for which I am forever grateful for. She has given me this gift of allowing me to see my passion for animals and how much they can lead us through our lives.
  Because of this, I am pursuing a career in working with animals. I don't have it all figured out yet, but right now I am planning on getting a vet tech certification within the next year before graduating and possibly going to vet school. I am also considering a career in some kind of animal rescue or rehabilitation. Basically, this website is a fan page for my babies as well as my interests, as they have saved me and helped me want to find myself again <3</p>

      <p>Enough about me for now. Now I will tell you about Winnie and Cleo. I got Winnie when she was two months old and I was feeling impulsive and wanted a kitten. I saw her on an animal shelter website and drove 35 minutes to get her. The moment I held her, I knew I would be taking her home despite the shelter employee trying to get me to see the other kittens. If you don't know anything about kittens, they are absolute demons. I know I previously said that Winnie only showed me love, but I lied.
      She was horrible in the beginning. What made it the worst was how smart she was. She knew that she wasn't supposed to be tearing down my hanging lights or ripping her claws into the carpet, but she would look right at me while she was doing it and wait for me to come yell at her. It wasn't funny in the moment, but now I love her for it. She had so many little quirks as a kitten that she still does to this day including laying in the sink, sleeping on her back with her paws in the air, trying to turn 
      the doorknob to let herself out of my room, being extra sweet when she's sleepy, etc. However, she has never been a cuddly cat, but recently she has been sleeping on my chest or in my lap. I think she knows I need it. For Cleo, I adopted her because my old roommates had cats and I was afraid that Winnie would be lonely when they had to eventually move out. (This kind of backfired because they hate each other.) I haven't had Cleo for long, but she is very sweet. She follows me absolutely everywhere, 
      which is annoying but also sweet that she loves me so much. Despite this, she is dumb as could be. There is not a single thought in her head, but she tries her best.</p>
